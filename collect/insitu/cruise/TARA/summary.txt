Abstract:	The Tara Oceans Expedition (2009-2013) sampled the world oceans on board a 36 m long schooner, collecting environmental data and organisms from viruses to planktonic metazoans for later analyses using modern sequencing and state-of-the-art imaging technologies. Tara Oceans Data are particularly suited to study the genetic, morphological and functional diversity of plankton. During the entire expedition (2009-2013), underway measurements were obtained from a meteorological station (BATOS), a thermosalinograph (TSG, SBE 45), a Fast Repetition Rate Flurometer (FRRF, LIFT-FRR01), and a spectrophotometer (WETLabs AC-S). In 2013 underway measurements were enhanced by adding a Photosynthetically Available Radiation (PAR) sensor (QCP2350, Biospherical Instruments, Inc.), a laser spectrofluorometer (WETLabs ALFA, Chekalyuk et al., 2012) that replaced the FRRF, a spectral backscattering sensor (WETLabs Eco-bb3), a pCO2 sensor (ProOceanus CO2-Pro), a pH sensor (Satlantic, SeaFET) and a particle imaging system triggered by chlorophyll-a fluorescence (a prototype of McLane Research Laboratories' Imaging FlowCytobot, Sosik Lab, WHOI). Discrete measurements of CDOM absorption measurements were made using an Ultrapath (WPI Inc.) to calibrate the in-line AC-S. Hence the AC-S was also used to provide CDOM absorption in addition to particulate matter properties.
	The present collection includes three data sets that are harmonised with a common time stamp. The source data sets given in the reference section.
