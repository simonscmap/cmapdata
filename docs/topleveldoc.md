#rough ideas:

cmapingest is a collection of scripts organized into dataset collection (collect), dataset processing (process), dataset ingestion (ingest) and a data vault structure file (vault_structure). These docs should provide a primer on data flow into CMAP's databases along with suggested improvements. 

-Overview, the code secitons (ingest, process,collect)

- walkthough of ingesting a dataset from validator to servers

- reingested/updating a dataset

- common pitfalls, errors

- future work to do, improvements
